Thank you for trying the School Scheduler System.

To use the application use one of the two following ways:

Option 1 - using the example files:
1)	Open a terminal and go the the folder where the SchoolSchedulerSystem.jar file is located.
2)	Execute the SchoolSchedulerSystem.jar system.
3)	Press "Run" without selecting any files, the application will select the files provided in the folder "inputs".
4)	Once the scheduling process is done and the optimization process has started, click "Print results" at any moment to see the generated schedules up to that moment in the optimization process.


Option 2 - only possible if you manually specify the file paths.
1)	Double click the SchoolSchedulerSystem.jar.
2)	Specify all required files in the input fields(example files can be found in the "inputs" folder).
3)	Press "Run" without selecting any files, the application will select the files provided in the folder "inputs".
4)	Once the scheduling process is done and the optimization process has started, click "Print results" at any moment to see the generated schedules up to that moment in the optimization process.
